**Project overview**\
This project is a data engineering solution built on Microsoft Azure, designed to process Zomato sales data following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers). It automates data workflows by enabling incremental data loading and transforming the data using PySpark. The transformed data is then stored in Azure Synapse, where itâ€™s analyzed and visualized through Power BI.
